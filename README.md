## Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of the COT5405 - Analysis of Algorithms course. The objective was to develop algorithms and conduct analyses for solving specific problems related to stock trading, focusing on maximizing profits through various approaches.

## Task Completed
* **Algorithm Design & Analysis**: Designed algorithms with specified time complexities for three different problem scenarios related to stock trading.
* **Implementation**: Implemented the designed algorithms in C++.
* **Proof of Correctness**: Provided detailed proofs of correctness for each algorithm.
* **Experimental Comparative Study**: Conducted an experimental study comparing the performance of different algorithms under varying parameters such as the number of stocks, number of days, and number of transactions.
* **Documentation**: Created a comprehensive README file summarizing the project, detailing the contributions of each team member, and providing execution instructions.

## Execution Instruction
* Clone the repository.
* Compile the C++ code using the provided makefile.
* Execute the compiled program to run the experiments and view the results.

 ## Conclusion
  This project provided valuable insights into algorithm design, analysis, and implementation, particularly in the context of solving optimization problems related to stock trading. It challenged the team members to think critically, apply various algorithmic techniques, and effectively communicate their findings.
